# .ljus(n) / .rjust(n)
The ```.ljust or .rjust``` functions are designed to place the defined string to the left or right of a new string that is (n) long. If the definded width is wider, the string is "padded out" with blanks.

The blanks can be replaced with another string which is repeated until the blank space is full.

```ruby
str = "Words in a string"

str.rjust(20)     # =$ "   Words in a string"
str.ljust(20)     # =$ "Words in a string   "
str.rjust(20,'£') # =$ "£££Words in a string" (padded with "£")
str.ljust(20,'$') # =$ "Words in a string$$$" (padded with "$")
```

# .center(n) _not .centre!_
The ```.center(n)``` function centres the defined string to the width of characters provided by (n) if the string is longer than (n) it just becomes left justified.

And remember its center not centre!

# .start_with?("")

If you find yourself looking for a comparator for the start of a string the ```.start_with?``` function is great due to being case specific and also faster that a simple regexp (more info on regexp next time...) and can also accept multiple strings to search for.

```ruby
str = "Bananas"
str.start_with?("Ban")  # => "True"
str.start_with?("B")    # => "True"
str.start_with?("ban")  # => "False"
str.start_with?("Car","Can")  # => "False"
str.start_with?("Ban","Can")  # => "True"

```
