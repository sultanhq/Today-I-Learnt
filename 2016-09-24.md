# each.with_index(n)

Today I nailed the understanding of ```each.with_index(n)```

This function iterates the given array/hash with an index for each item.

_The (n) sets the starting value of the index and can be an defined as an integer of an external variable._

```ruby
array_of_hashes = [
{name: "Dave", age: 18, sex: "male"},
{name: "Bill", age: 21, sex: "male"},
{name: "Ruby", age: 33, sex: "female"},
{name: "John", age: 20, sex: "male"}
]

def print_array(array,offset)
  array.each.with_index(offset) do |hash,index|
    print "#{index}" # prints the index (this could be interpolated with next line but is just to help explain the code)
    puts ". #{hash[:name]} is #{hash[:age]} years old and is #{hash[:sex]}"
  end
end

print_array(array_of_hashes,1)

# =>
1. Dave is 18 years old and is male
2. Bill is 21 years old and is male
3. Ruby is 33 years old and is female
4. John is 20 years old and is male
```

# system  & "clear"

This is quite a simple topic but useful is doing console based operations in ruby.

All it does is ... sends the "clear" command to the console, which _clears_ the screen! simples.

```system "clear" ```

# git ignore

I found this git tool today after I added all the files in the repo and inadvertently added my notes file to a repo. A short google gave me the .gitignore tool.

To use .gitignore it's really simple

Create a .gitignore file with touch
```
$ touch .gitignore
```

In the `.gitignore` file you can list the files the git will ignore
```
keys.txt (this will ignore the keys.txt file (with relative path))
example/keys.txt (this will ignore the keys.txt file in the example directory)
/example/ (this ignores the entire example directory)
keys* (this will ignore all files whose name starts with keys)
*.txt (this will ignore all .txt files)
```
