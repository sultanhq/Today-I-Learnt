# each.with_index(n)

Today I nailed the understanding of ```each.with_index(n)```

This function iterates the given array/hash with an index for each item.

_The (n) sets the starting value of the index and can be an defined as an integer of an external variable._

```ruby
array_of_hashes = [
{name: "Dave", age: 18, sex: "male"},
{name: "Bill", age: 21, sex: "male"},
{name: "Ruby", age: 33, sex: "female"},
{name: "John", age: 20, sex: "male"}
]

def print_array(array,offset)
  array.each.with_index(1) do |hash,index|
    print "#{index}" # prints the index (this could be interpolated with next line but is just to help explain the code)
    puts ". #{hash[:name]} is #{hash[:age]} years old and is #{hash[:sex]}"
  end
end

print_array(array_of_hashes,1)

# =>
1. Dave is 18 years old and is male
2. Bill is 21 years old and is male
3. Ruby is 33 years old and is female
4. John is 20 years old and is male
```
